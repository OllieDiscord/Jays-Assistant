# Jay's Assistant Contribution Guide

First off, thanks for taking some time into contributing for Jay's Assistant! This guide will help you along the way of what to do.

## Setup

1. Fork & clone this repository, make sure it is on the **main** branch.
2. Install dependencies ` npm i `.
3. Make some new additions.
4. Test the bot ` node . `
5. If all goes well create a PR.

## Rewards

All contributors will get a fancy role on JayCord named ` Github Contributor ` to show off (not flex literally but you get the idea).

Members with this role get exclusive access to development channels and a bunch more.

## Extra Notes

PRs that lack good changes or details will be closed and ignored, also do not make stupid/troll PRs.

Have fun!
